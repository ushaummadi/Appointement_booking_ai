# TailorTalk Assignment Submission

## 🎯 Assignment Requirements ✅ COMPLETED

**Technical Stack Requirements:**
✅ Backend: Python with FastAPI  
✅ Agent Framework: LangGraph for conversation flow  
✅ Frontend: Streamlit chat interface  
✅ LLM/Chat Model: Google Gemini API  
✅ Google Calendar Integration: Service Account authentication  
✅ Conversational AI: Natural language booking capability  

## 🚀 Live Demo Links

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Easiest)
**Streamlit Frontend URL**: [Click Deploy in Replit to get URL]
**Backend API URL**: [Same domain, port 8000]

### Option 2: External Platform Deployment
All deployment files are ready for Railway, Render, or Fly.io:
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment
- `render.yaml` - Render deployment
- `fly.toml` - Fly.io deployment

## 🎯 How to Test the Assignment

**Try these natural language booking commands:**

1. **Basic Booking**: "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
2. **Smart Scheduling**: "Book a 1-hour call next Tuesday morning"  
3. **Availability Check**: "Find me an available slot this week"
4. **Specific Details**: "Can you schedule a meeting with John on Friday at 3pm for 30 minutes?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- System checks Google Calendar availability
- Suggests alternative times if slot is busy
- Confirms bookings with calendar integration
- Maintains conversation context across interactions

## 📊 Technical Architecture

**Microservices Design:**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit on port 5000
- **Backend**: FastAPI on port 8000  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **AI**: Google Gemini for natural language processing
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API with Service Account

**Advanced Features:**
- Persistent conversation history
- Database-backed calendar event tracking
- LangGraph state machine for complex conversations
- Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

For deployment, set these environment variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Service account credentials
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
